# Using the template
## Overview
For now, the session notes template is fairly simple. It has 3 sections for Session Summary, Characters, and Locations.
## Sections
The main idea is that the session summary should kind of be the only 'full text' write-up in the note. The others are meant to contain lists of links to other dedicated notes about people and places with small associated tidbits that are session specific. Everyone takes notes differently, so of course feel free to do what you like.
## Audio Recorder
To the right of each session note is a "Session Recording" section. This will allow you to record the audio from your session and leave timestamped notes in real-time. To start, click "Start Recording". You won't notice much of a change, but if you look to the left obsidian toolbar, you will see the microphone icon is active. 

While this is active, you can click the "New Timestamp" button to create an entry for the current timestamp. These entries are composed of 3 elements: First is the timestamp itself. This is not an absolute timestamp, but relative to the recording start so the moment is easy to find when scrubbing through the recording. Next is a badge for the note. I use these to categorize my notes and complement the next element, the note description. The note description is a simple text element to describe the moment. There is no character limit, but for display purposes I recommend keeping it short. Again, the intention is for this to be a simple way to leave notes for yourself for later and then you can always create and link dedicated notes to elaborate on these points, or do so in the body of the session notes. The form to create a timestamp should give a preview of what your note will look like before you add it, but if you want a full rundown of all the available badge options, see [Badges](Documentation/Badges.md).

When the session is complete, click "Stop Recording". The audio recording will be saved and embedded into the Session Note.

# Note
The current template does not support resuming recording. If you accidentally stop the recording and then start it again, things will break.
