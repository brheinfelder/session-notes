# Intro
This is the beginnings of tools that I intend to build for D&D 5e in Obsidian. For now it just takes the form of a vault template, but I will probably venture into developing a dedicated plugin some time down the line. I am open to feature suggestions, but I will be prioritizing the features that I myself will use. I have no idea if any of this is compatible with mobile versions of Obsidian and I won't be trying to ensure compatibility until the point where I feel it is necessary to develop my own plugin. For now, the following features are included:
- Campaigns Homepage
- Campaign Overview
- Session Note Template
	- Audio Recording Interface
		- Timestamp Notes
	- Summary, Characters, Locations sections
I will update this list as I continue development.
